- **GoRouter**: Declarative routing with authentication guards
- **StatefulShellRoute**: Bottom navigation with state preservation
- **Route Protection**: Automatic redirection based on auth state

### Data Layer

- **Dio**: HTTP client for API communication
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation of data sources
- **SharedPreferences**: Local storage for preferences

### Internationalization

- **Flutter Localizations**: Built-in i18n support
- **ARB Files**: Localized strings for English and Portuguese

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **FVM (Flutter Version Manager)** - Required for managing Flutter SDK versions
- Flutter SDK 3.8+ (managed via FVM)
- Dart SDK 3.8+ (comes with Flutter)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Android SDK for Android development
- Xcode for iOS development (macOS only)

### FVM Setup (Required)

This project uses FVM to ensure consistent Flutter versions across all developers.

```bash
# Verify FVM installation
fvm --version
fvm doctor
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my_games_list/app
   ```

2. **Set up Flutter SDK version**

   ```bash
   # Install and use the project's Flutter version
   fvm install
   fvm use
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   fvm flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Generate localization files**

   ```bash
   fvm flutter gen-l10n
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   fvm flutter run
   ```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the app root:

```
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
WEB_BASE_URL=https://mygameslist.com
```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
fvm flutter test

# Run specific test file
fvm flutter test test/features/library/bloc/library_bloc_test.dart

# Run with coverage
fvm flutter test --coverage

# Generate coverage report (requires lcov)
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

### Code Generation

```bash
# Generate localization files
fvm flutter gen-l10n

# Or use Makefile
make l10n
```

### Code Analysis

```bash
fvm flutter analyze
```

### Project Conventions

- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, etc.)
- **Naming**: PascalCase for classes, snake_case for files, camelCase for variables
- **Testing**: Mandatory for all BLoC events and repository methods
- **Localization**: Always use `context.l10n.stringKey` for user-facing text

## Building for Production

### Android

```bash
fvm flutter build apk --release
# or
fvm flutter build appbundle --release
```

### iOS

```bash
fvm flutter build ios --release
```

### Web

```bash
fvm flutter build web --release
```

## API Integration

This app connects to a Go backend API that integrates with IGDB (Internet Game Database) for game information.

### Key Endpoints

- `/auth/*` - Authentication (signup, signin, logout)
- `/games/*` - Game discovery and search
- `/library/*` - User's game library management
- `/users/:id/library` - Public library viewing

For API documentation, see the [API README](../api/README.md).

## Contributing

### Code Style

- Follow Dart/Flutter conventions
- Use `fvm flutter analyze` to check code quality
- Maintain test coverage for new features
- Always use localized strings for UI text

### Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Run `fvm flutter analyze` and `fvm flutter test`
4. Submit pull request

### Adding New Features

1. Create feature directory under `lib/features/<feature_name>/`
2. Add `CLAUDE.md` documentation file
3. Implement Clean Architecture layers (data, domain, presentation)
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Update localization files if needed
