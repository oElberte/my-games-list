- View detailed game information including descriptions and images
- Add/remove games from your favorites list
- Persistent favorites storage across app sessions

### 🔐 User Authentication

- Secure user login and registration
- Persistent authentication state
- User profile management

### ⚙️ Settings & Preferences

- Toggle between light and dark themes
- Preference persistence across app restarts
- User-friendly settings interface

### 🌐 Web Integration

- Built-in web view for additional content
- Seamless navigation between native and web content

## Architecture

### State Management

- **MobX**: Reactive state management for real-time UI updates
- **Stores**: Organized business logic with AuthStore, HomeStore, and SettingsStore
- **Observables**: Automatic UI updates when data changes

### Dependency Injection

- **GetIt**: Service locator pattern for dependency management
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation of concerns with abstract interfaces

### Navigation

- **GoRouter**: Declarative routing with authentication guards
- **Route Protection**: Automatic redirection based on authentication state

### Data Persistence

- **SharedPreferences**: Local storage for user preferences and favorites
- **JSON Serialization**: Type-safe data models with automatic serialization

## Technologies Used

### Core Framework

- **Flutter**: Multi-platform UI toolkit
- **Dart**: Programming language

### State Management

- **MobX**: 2.4.0 - Reactive state management
- **MobX Codegen**: 2.7.0 - Code generation for MobX

### Dependency Injection

- **GetIt**: 8.0.2 - Service locator

### Navigation

- **GoRouter**: 14.6.1 - Declarative routing

### Storage

- **SharedPreferences**: 2.3.3 - Local data persistence

### Web Integration

- **WebView Flutter**: 4.10.0 - In-app web browser

### Development Tools

- **Build Runner**: 2.4.8 - Code generation
- **Flutter Lints**: 5.0.0 - Dart linting rules

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.24.0 or later
- Dart SDK 3.5.0 or later
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Android SDK for Android development
- Xcode for iOS development (macOS only)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my_games_list
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate code**

   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Development Setup

1. **Code Generation** (for MobX stores)

   ```bash
   # One-time generation
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build

   # Watch mode for development
   flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
   ```

2. **Running Tests**

   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   flutter test

   # Run with coverage
   flutter test --coverage
   ```

3. **Code Analysis**
   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   ```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

### Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Model and service logic
- **Widget Tests**: UI component behavior
- **Store Tests**: State management logic
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
flutter test

# Specific test file
flutter test test/stores/auth_store_test.dart

# With coverage report
flutter test --coverage
```

### Test Coverage

- 75+ test cases covering all major functionality
- Model serialization and validation
- Store state management and persistence
- Service layer implementations
- UI widget behavior

## Building for Production

### Android

```bash
flutter build apk --release
# or
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### iOS

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

### Web

```bash
flutter build web --release
```

## Configuration

### Environment Setup

The app uses service locator pattern for dependency injection. All services are registered in `main.dart`:

```dart
void setupServiceLocator() {
  GetIt.instance.registerLazySingleton<LocalStorageService>(
    () => SharedPreferencesService(),
  );
  // Additional services...
}
```

### Router Configuration

Navigation is handled by GoRouter with authentication guards:

```dart
final appRouter = GoRouter(
  initialLocation: '/login',
  redirect: (context, state) {
    // Authentication logic
  },
  routes: [
    // Route definitions
  ],
);
```

## Performance Considerations

### State Management

- MobX provides efficient reactive updates
- Computed values for derived state
- Automatic disposal of observers

### Storage

- Asynchronous operations for non-blocking UI
- Efficient JSON serialization
- Minimal storage footprint

### UI

- Material 3 design system
- Responsive layouts
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Contributing

### Code Style

- Follow Dart/Flutter conventions
- Use `flutter analyze` to check code quality
- Maintain test coverage for new features

### Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`
4. Submit pull request

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

- `feat: add new feature`
- `fix: resolve bug`
- `test: add test coverage`
- `docs: update documentation`
